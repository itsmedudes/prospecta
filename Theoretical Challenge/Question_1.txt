1. How will you tackle the challenge above?

ans => 

To tackle the challenge, I would first parse the CSV input to extract the cell values and formulas. Then, I would evaluate the formulas to determine the resulting values. Finally, I would write the cell values to a new CSV file.

1) Read the file from the directories.
2) Read the that csv file through BufferedReader;
3) I have to check it contains the space or "," between the export csv file if conatins then split into part that output will give the result in the array;

4) after spliting i have to if it conatin "=" then i have to also split again add or whatever sign those value which next to "=". 
5) print format which give in answer.
