Q1. How will you tackle the challenge above?

ans => 

To tackle the challenge, I would first parse the CSV input to extract the cell values and formulas. Then, I would evaluate the formulas to determine the resulting values. Finally, I would write the cell values to a new CSV file.

1) Read the file from the directories.
2) Read the that csv file through BufferedReader;
3) I have to check it contains the space or "," between the export csv file if conatins then split into part that output will give the result in the array;
4) after spliting i have to if it conatin "=" then i have to also split again add or whatever sign those value which next to "=". 
5) print format which give in answer.

Q2. What type of errors you would you check for?
Ans =>

1) Syntax errors i will make sure use proper operator and operands
2) Referenced cells that do not exist
3) If i got a zero in csv file i have handle that condition if any value divide by zero i will give a arthmetic exception how i handle i use double value so it solve that problem.
4) Type errors and handling all the exception;

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Q3. How might a user break your code?
Ans =>
1) Providing invalid input to the CSV file.
2) Attempting to reference cells that do not exist in the input.
3) Providing formulas with syntax errors.
4) Providing formulas that result in division by zero or other illegal operations(if will not handle then).
